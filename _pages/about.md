Hyungro is an [ECE](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) postdoctoral research associate at The State University of New Jersey working under the guidance of Professor [Shantenu Jha](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/shantenu-jha). He is a member of the Research in Advanced DIstributed Cyber- infrastructure and Applications Laboratory (RADICAL). Hyungro obtained his Ph.D. from Indiana University, Bloomington where he focused on building software-defined systems with reproducible software environments. Hyungro's current research includes performance analysis of scientific applications with distributed machine learning framework at scale which requires techniques and software developments to measure resource efficiency of running the applications on high-performance computing. He is also interested in system design, performance profiling, and resource monitoring to enable large-scale computing and data analysis using workflow tools. He is a member of [DeepDriveMD](http://deepdrivemd.github.io/) project to satisfy computational requirement by harnessing HPC resources and advanced data analytics.
