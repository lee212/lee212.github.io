Hyungro is an postdoctoral research associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
He is a
member of the Scalable Computing & Data team in the High Performance Computing Group within the Advanced Computing, Mathematics, and Data Division at PNNL. Hyungro obtained his Ph.D. from Indiana
University, Bloomington where he focused on building software-defined systems
with reproducible software environments in the [Digital Science
Center](https://www.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/) working with Professor [Geoffrey
Fox at UVa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/geoffrey-c-fox). Hyungro's
current research includes performance analysis of scientific applications with
distributed machine learning framework at scale which requires techniques and
software developments to measure resource efficiency of running the
applications on high-performance computing. He is also interested in performance profiling, and resource monitoring to enable large-scale
computing and data analysis using workflow tools. He was a member of the
[DeepDriveMD](http://deepdrivemd.github.io/) project to satisfy computational
requirement by harnessing HPC resources and advanced data analytics.
